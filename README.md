Flight Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts flight prices based on various factors such as airline, source city, destination city, stops, and travel class. The goal of this project is to provide users with an estimate of flight prices, helping them make informed decisions when planning their travels.

Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized flight patterns, class distribution, and average prices using interactive plots.
- Linear Regression Model: Built a linear regression model to predict flight prices based on input features.
- User-Friendly Interface: Created an interactive interface for users to input flight details and receive predicted prices.

Project Structure:
- `data`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, EDA, and model development.
- `app`: Flask-based web application allowing users to interact with the trained model.
- `static` and `templates`: Assets and HTML templates for the web application.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd flight-price-prediction`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the web application: `python app/app.py`
5. Access the application in your browser: `http://localhost:5000`

Contributions and Feedback:
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or want to add new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback is valuable in making this project even better.

Note: This project is for educational and demonstration purposes. The predictions may not be 100% accurate and should not replace official pricing information.
